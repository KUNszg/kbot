# Getting Started

This is a Twitch chatbot made by KUNszg

Fairly easy to get started

1. `sudo git clone https://github.com/KUNszg/kbot.git`
2. cd into the bot's folder
3. `npm i -f`
4. Edit the api keys in `config.js`

# Note:
- bot is not meant to run on other machines (most likely won't work because of database integration)
- it's meant to be a project that you get inspired of, I don't take any responsibility for damage on other machines

this repo is going to be stored in an arctic vault and will last over 500 years there, if you see this message im probably dead by that time :) also if you read this i von ZULUL
