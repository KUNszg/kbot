# Getting Started

This is a Twitch chatbot made by KUNszg

Fairly easy to get started

1. `sudo git clone https://github.com/KUNszg/kbot.git`
2. cd into the bot's folder
3. `npm i -f`
4. Edit the api keys in `lib/credentials/config_template.js`

# Note:
- bot is not meant to run on other machines (most likely won't work because of database integration)
- it's meant to be a project that you get inspired of, I don't take any responsibility for damage on other machines 4Head
