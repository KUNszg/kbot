# Getting Started

This is a Twitch chatbot made by KUNszg

Fairly easy to get started

1. `sudo git clone https://github.com/KUNszg/kbot.git`
2. cd into the bot's folder
3. `npm i -f`
4. edit the api keys in `lib/credentials/config_template.js`
5. since most of the bot is integrated with database, you need to either adjust the code yourself or create tables manually.
